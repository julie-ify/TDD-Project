# TDD-Project

In this project we implemented a class with some methods, but we do it by doing test-driven development (TDD). Remember that the idea is to write tests first and then the code. 

## Getting Started

- Make sure you have `Ruby` installed in your system. You can install it [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/
).

- Clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/julie-ify/TDD-Project.git` in your command line.

- Navigate to the repository by running `cd TDD-Project`.

- Run the project by running `ruby solver.rb` on the command line.

- To run the `tests` make sure you install rspec gem by running `gem install rspec` on the command line then run `rspec spec` on the command line to see the test passing

## Optional

- Run `bundle install` to install the `Ruby Gems` including `Rubocop`.
